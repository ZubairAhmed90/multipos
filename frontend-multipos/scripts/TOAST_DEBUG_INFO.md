# 🔧 Toast Debugging - Login Page

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The toasts are not working on the login page. Let me debug this step by step.

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps Added**

### **Console Logs Added:**
1. **Error Detection** - `console.log('Error detected, showing toast:', error)`
2. **Success Detection** - `console.log('Success detected, showing toast for user:', user.username || user.email)`
3. **Toast Close** - `console.log('Closing toast')`
4. **Toast State** - `console.log('Toast state:', toast)` (in render)

### **Potential Issues:**

1. **Timing Issue** - Success toast might be triggered too quickly before redirect
2. **State Issue** - Toast state might not be updating properly
3. **Material-UI Issue** - Snackbar component might have compatibility issues
4. **Z-index Issue** - Toast might be rendered behind other elements

## 🛠️ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Success Toast Timing:**
- Added 1.5 second delay before redirect
- Moved redirect logic to success toast effect
- Removed duplicate redirect logic

### **2. Added Debug Logging:**
- Console logs to track toast state changes
- Error and success detection logging
- Toast close handler logging

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions:**

1. **Test Error Toast:**
   - Enter invalid credentials
   - Check browser console for "Error detected, showing toast:" message
   - Verify red toast appears

2. **Test Success Toast:**
   - Enter valid credentials (shahjahan@multipos.com / Shahjahan@123)
   - Check browser console for "Success detected, showing toast for user:" message
   - Verify green toast appears for 1.5 seconds before redirect

3. **Check Console Output:**
   - Look for "Toast state:" logs showing current toast state
   - Verify toast.open changes from false to true

## 🔧 **Next Steps:**

If toasts still don't work, we may need to:
1. Check Material-UI version compatibility
2. Try alternative toast library (react-hot-toast, react-toastify)
3. Check for CSS conflicts
4. Verify Snackbar component is properly imported

**Please test the login with both invalid and valid credentials and check the browser console for debug messages.**
