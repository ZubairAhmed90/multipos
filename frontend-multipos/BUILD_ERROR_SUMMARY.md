# Build Error Summary

## Current Error
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
at extraReducers
```

This error is occurring during the Next.js build process, specifically in the server-side rendering (SSR) phase when loading Redux slices.

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. POS Terminal Page (`pos/terminal/page.js`)
- Fixed unescaped quotes on lines 4517, 4522

### 2. Purchase Orders Page (`purchase-orders/page.js`)
- Fixed useEffect dependencies on lines 183-191
- Added fetchPurchaseOrder to fetch full order details

### 3. Purchase Orders Slice (`purchaseOrdersSlice.js`)
- Added safe access to `action.payload` in all reducers
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) and fallback values

### 4. Financial Vouchers Slice (`financialVoucherSlice.js`)
- Added `Array.isArray()` check before `.map()` call

## If Build Still Fails

This could be due to:
1. **Build cache** - The `.next` directory has cached the old code
2. **Another slice file** - There might be another slice with a similar issue
3. **Next.js optimization** - SSR is failing on a page that uses these slices

## Recommendations

1. **Clear cache manually:**
   ```bash
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
   npm run build
   ```

2. **If still failing, temporarily disable SSR for testing:**
   - Modify `next.config.js` to check if it's a SSR issue

3. **Check which slice is causing the error:**
   - The error points to `extraReducers` which suggests a Redux slice
   - Try building without the purchase orders or financial vouchers pages

## All Files Modified

1. `app/dashboard/pos/terminal/page.js`
2. `app/dashboard/purchase-orders/page.js`
3. `app/store/slices/purchaseOrdersSlice.js`
4. `app/store/slices/financialVoucherSlice.js`

All the code fixes are in place. The build should work after clearing the cache.
