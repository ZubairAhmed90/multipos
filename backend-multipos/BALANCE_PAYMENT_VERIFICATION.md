# Balance Payment Verification

## POS Display Check ✅

### Scenario: Shahbaz Balance Payment
- **Initial Credit Balance**: -300
- **Purchase Amount**: 280
- **Payment Method**: Balance Payment
- **Payment Amount**: 0 (using balance)
- **Credit Used**: 280
- **Remaining Balance**: -20

### Display is Correct ✅

The POS display shows:
- Current Purchase Amount: 280.00
- Available Credit Balance: 300.00
- Remaining Balance After Purchase: -20.00

All calculations are correct!

## Formula Verification

### Backend Formula:
```javascript
runningBalance = previousRunningBalance + (billAmount - finalPaymentAmount)
runningBalance = -300 + (280 - 0)
runningBalance = -300 + 280
runningBalance = -20 ✅
```

### POS Display Formula:
```javascript
Remaining Balance = Outstanding Total + Bill Amount
Remaining Balance = -300 + 280
Remaining Balance = -20 ✅
```

Both formulas give the same result!

## What Gets Stored in Database

When this sale is completed, the database should store:
- `total`: 280 (bill amount)
- `payment_amount`: 0
- `credit_amount`: 280
- `running_balance`: -20 ✅

## Action Items

1. ✅ POS display is correct
2. ⏳ Complete the sale using "SALE ONLY" button
3. ⏳ Verify ledger shows -20 instead of -300
4. ⏳ Verify outstanding balance updates to -20

## Next Steps

After clicking "SALE ONLY":
1. Sale should be processed with balance -20
2. Customer ledger should show:
   - Old balance: -300
   - New transaction: Buy 280, Pay 0
   - New balance: -20
3. Outstanding balance query should return -20

If balance remains -300, check:
- Backend logs for the sale transaction
- Database for the stored running_balance value
- Customer ledger refresh
