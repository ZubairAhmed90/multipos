# Complete Fix Summary - Customer Credit System

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. Customer Ledger Display
- **Fixed:** Negative payment amounts treated as 0
- **Fixed:** Running balance calculated correctly
- **Fixed:** Payment status shows "Paid" when balance is 0
- **File:** `customerLedgerController.js`

### 2. Outstanding Query
- **Fixed:** Shows -6,200 for Aslam (not nothing)
- **Fixed:** Handles negative payment amounts
- **Fixed:** Includes both positive and negative balances
- **File:** `salesController.js` (searchOutstandingPayments)

### 3. Main Customer List
- **Fixed:** Current balance calculated as `SUM(total - payment_amount)`
- **Fixed:** Treats negative payments as 0
- **File:** `customerLedgerController.js` (getAllCustomersWithSummaries)

### 4. Payment Status Logic
- **Fixed:** Sets status to "COMPLETED" when credit amount <= 0
- **Before:** Status was "PARTIAL" for overpayments
- **After:** Status is "COMPLETED" when payment is complete
- **File:** `salesController.js`

## Key Changes

### In `salesController.js`:

#### Line ~228-233: Credit Usage
```javascript
if (finalTotal < 0) {
  finalPaymentAmount = 0; // No cash paid
  finalCreditAmount = finalTotal; // Remaining credit
}
```

#### Line ~250-260: Payment Status
```javascript
if (finalCreditAmount > 0) {
  finalPaymentStatus = 'PENDING'; // Customer owes money
} else {
  finalPaymentStatus = 'COMPLETED'; // Payment complete or overpaid
}
```

#### Line ~2690: Outstanding Query
```sql
SUM(s.total - IF(s.payment_amount < 0, 0, s.payment_amount)) as total_outstanding
```

#### Line ~2714: HAVING Clause
```sql
HAVING ABS(total_outstanding) > 0.01
```

### In `customerLedgerController.js`:

#### Line ~225-226: Balance Calculation
```javascript
const actualPaid = paid < 0 ? 0 : paid;
runningBalance = oldBalance + (total - actualPaid);
```

#### Line ~258: Payment Display
```javascript
paid_amount: transaction.payment_method === 'FULLY_CREDIT' ? 0 : actualPaid
```

#### Line ~452-454: Main Customer Query
```sql
SUM(CASE WHEN s.payment_method = 'FULLY_CREDIT' THEN 0 ELSE IF(s.payment_amount < 0, 0, s.payment_amount) END) as total_paid,
SUM(s.total - IF(s.payment_amount < 0, 0, s.payment_amount)) as current_balance
```

#### Line ~596: Use SQL Balance
```javascript
const currentBalance = parseFloat(customer.current_balance || 0); // Use SQL-calculated balance
```
