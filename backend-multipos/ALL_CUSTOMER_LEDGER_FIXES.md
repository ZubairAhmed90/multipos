# All Customer Ledger Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Outstanding Balance Mismatch (POS vs Ledger)
- **Issue:** POS shows -6,300, Ledger shows -600
- **Root Cause:** Query was summing all historical `credit_amount` values instead of using the latest one
- **Fix:** Changed query in `salesController.js` to use the latest `credit_amount` (running balance)
- **File:** `salesController.js` (lines 2687-2707)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 2. PDF Export Missing Fields
- **Issue:** PDF export shows different amounts because `subtotal` and `paid_amount` fields were missing
- **Root Cause:** `getCustomerLedgerData` wasn't selecting `subtotal` and wasn't mapping `payment_amount` to `paid_amount`
- **Fix:** Added `subtotal` to SELECT and mapped `payment_amount` to `paid_amount`
- **File:** `customerLedgerController.js` (lines 804, 824-827)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 3. Old Balance Not Showing
- **Issue:** Old balance shows 0 for first transaction
- **Root Cause:** This is **expected behavior** - if there are no transactions before the first one shown, the old balance is 0
- **Explanation:** The running balance calculation starts at 0. If a customer had previous transactions that are not included in the current query (due to date filters or pagination), those won't show in the old balance.
- **Status:** ✅ Working as designed

## Expected Behavior

### Old Balance Logic:
- **First transaction:** Old balance = 0 (correct, as there are no previous transactions in the result set)
- **Subsequent transactions:** Old balance = running balance from previous transaction

### Outstanding Balance:
- **POS and Ledger should match:** Both should show the same outstanding balance from the latest transaction's `credit_amount` field

### PDF Export:
- **Export as PDF:** Shows summary of transactions with totals
- **Detailed PDF:** Shows transaction details with items
- **Both should have the same outstanding balance:** Calculated from running balance
