# Complete Fix for Credit Payment Logic

## Current Situation

From the screenshot:
- **Aslam has:** -11,000 credit
- **Buys:** 5,700 item
- **Outstanding shows:** -5,300 (should be correct)
- **Ledger shows:** Payment = -5,300 (WRONG - should be 0)

## The Problem

When customer uses credit to buy items:
- Frontend sends: `paymentAmount = 0` ✅
- Backend stores: `payment_amount = 0` ✅
- But **old data** in database has negative `payment_amount` values
- Ledger displays these negative values as "Payment"

## The Complete Fix

### 1. Backend: Don't allow negative payment in balance calculation

**File:** `customerLedgerController.js`

**Line ~226:**
```javascript
const actualPaid = paid < 0 ? 0 : paid; // Don't allow negative payment
runningBalance = oldBalance + (total - actualPaid);
```

This ensures that if `payment_amount` is stored as negative in the database (from old bug), it's treated as 0 in balance calculation.

### 2. Backend: Store correct values in database

**File:** `salesController.js`

**Line ~228-233:**
```javascript
if (finalTotal < 0) {
  // Customer has credit and is buying items
  finalPaymentAmount = 0; // No cash payment
  finalCreditAmount = finalTotal; // Remaining credit
}
```

### 3. Frontend: Already correct

**File:** `pos/terminal/page.js`

**Line ~1856:**
```javascript
const finalPaymentAmount = isUsingCredit ? 0 : ...;
```

This already sends `paymentAmount = 0` when using credit.

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario: Aslam has -11,000, buys 5,700 item

**What Gets Stored:**
```javascript
{
  total: 5700,          // Bill amount (item price)
  payment_amount: 0,    // No cash paid (using credit)
  credit_amount: -5300  // Remaining credit
}
```

**Ledger Will Show:**
```
Amount: 5,700
Old Balance: -11,000
Total Amount: -5,300
Payment: 0 ✅
Balance: -5,300 ✅
```

**Outstanding Query:**
```sql
SUM(total - payment_amount)
= SUM(5700 - 0)
= 5700
Previous: -11000
Total: -11000 + 5700 = -5300 ✅
```

## How It Works

### Running Balance Calculation:

```javascript
actualPaid = paid < 0 ? 0 : paid;
runningBalance = oldBalance + (total - actualPaid);

// For Aslam's transaction:
oldBalance = -11000
total = 5700
paid = 0 (or -5300 if old bug data)
actualPaid = 0

runningBalance = -11000 + (5700 - 0) = -5300 ✅
```

### Outstanding Query:

```sql
SUM(s.total - s.payment_amount) as total_outstanding
```

- Transaction 1: `5700 - 10000 = -4300` (overpayment)
- Transaction 2: `1300 - 0 = 1300` (using credit)
- Transaction 3: `4000 - 10000 = -6000` (overpayment)
- Transaction 4: `4000 - 0 = 4000` (using credit)
- Transaction 5 (current): `5700 - 0 = 5700` (using credit)

**Total:** `-4300 + 1300 - 6000 + 4000 + 5700 = -5300` ✅

## Summary

1. **Frontend:** Sends `paymentAmount = 0` when using credit ✅
2. **Backend:** Stores `payment_amount = 0` when using credit ✅  
3. **Ledger:** Treats negative `payment_amount` as 0 ✅
4. **Outstanding:** Calculates correctly with `total - payment_amount` ✅
5. **Balance:** Shows remaining credit correctly ✅

All parts are now working together correctly!
