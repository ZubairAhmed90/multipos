# Purchase Order Status Validation Fix

## Issue

When trying to approve a purchase order, the API returns:
```
Invalid status. Must be one of: PENDING, ORDERED, DELIVERED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
```

But the frontend is sending 'APPROVED' status.

## Root Cause

The backend validation in `purchaseOrderController.js` was only allowing these statuses:
- PENDING
- ORDERED  
- DELIVERED
- COMPLETED
- CANCELLED

But the frontend `purchase-orders/page.js` uses these statuses:
- PENDING
- APPROVED
- ORDERED
- SHIPPED
- DELIVERED
- CANCELLED

## Fix Applied

**File:** `purchaseOrderController.js` (line 227)

**Changed from:**
```javascript
const validStatuses = ['PENDING', 'ORDERED', 'DELIVERED', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'];
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
const validStatuses = ['PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'ORDERED', 'SHIPPED', 'DELIVERED', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'];
```

**Added:**
- 'APPROVED' - for when purchase orders are approved
- 'SHIPPED' - for when items are shipped (used in frontend)

## Expected Behavior

After deploying:
- Purchase orders can be approved (PENDING â†’ APPROVED)
- Purchase orders can be marked as shipped (ORDERED â†’ SHIPPED)
- Purchase orders can be marked as delivered (SHIPPED â†’ DELIVERED)

## Workflow

The purchase order status workflow is now:
1. **PENDING** - Initial status when created
2. **APPROVED** - When admin approves the order
3. **ORDERED** - When order is placed with supplier
4. **SHIPPED** - When items are shipped by supplier
5. **DELIVERED** - When items are received
6. **COMPLETED** - When all items are verified and added to inventory
7. **CANCELLED** - If order is cancelled

## Files Modified

1. **`purchaseOrderController.js`** - Added 'APPROVED' and 'SHIPPED' to valid statuses
