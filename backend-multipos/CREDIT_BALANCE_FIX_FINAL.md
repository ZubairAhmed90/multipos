# Final Fix for Credit Balance Calculation

## Problem

When customer uses credit to buy items, the balance goes to 0 instead of showing the remaining credit.

### Example from Screenshot:
- Old Balance: -4,300
- Amount: 1,300
- Payment: -3,000 (WRONG!)
- Balance: 0 (WRONG! Should be -3,000)

## Root Cause

The frontend was sending **negative payment amounts** when using credit (e.g., -3,000), which was getting stored in the database and causing the balance calculation to be incorrect.

## The Fix

### In `customerLedgerController.js`:
Ensure `payment_amount` is never negative in the balance calculation:

```javascript
const actualPaid = paid < 0 ? 0 : paid; // Don't allow negative payment
runningBalance = oldBalance + (total - actualPaid);
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix:

#### Scenario: Customer has -4,300 credit, buys 1,300 item

**Database Should Store:**
```javascript
{
  total: 1300,           // Bill amount (item price)
  payment_amount: 0,     // No cash paid (or could be stored as negative in DB)
  credit_amount: -3000   // Remaining credit after using 1300
}
```

**But if frontend sends payment_amount = -3000:**
```javascript
// Backend calculation:
actualPaid = paid < 0 ? 0 : paid;  // actualPaid = 0
runningBalance = -4300 + (1300 - 0) = -3000 ✅
```

## Expected Results

### Transaction 2 (Buying with Credit):
- **Amount:** 1,300
- **Old Balance:** -4,300
- **Total Amount:** -3,000 (Old + Amount)
- **Payment:** 0 (not -3,000!)
- **Balance:** -3,000 ✅

### Outstanding Query:
```sql
SUM(s.total - s.payment_amount)
```

- Transaction 1: `5700 - 10000 = -4300`
- Transaction 2: `1300 - 0 = 1300`
- **Total:** `-4300 + 1300 = -3000` ✅

## Summary

The fix ensures that when payment_amount is negative (which happens when frontend uses negative values for credit transactions), it's treated as 0 in the balance calculation, preventing the balance from incorrectly going to 0.
