# Customer Ledger Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Old Balance Not Showing
- **Problem:** Customer Ledger shows "Old Balance: 0" for early transactions
- **Root Cause:** The `runningBalance` starts at 0, so for the first transaction, the old balance is always 0
- **Expected Behavior:** For Dr. Ameen's first transaction (PTZL-000079), the old balance should be 0 because there were no previous transactions

### 2. Outstanding Balance Mismatch
- **Problem:** POS shows 26,000, Customer Ledger shows 51,000
- **Root Cause:** The outstanding query was returning the latest `credit_amount` (26,000) instead of the running balance (51,000)
- **Expected Behavior:** For Dr. Ameen:
  - PTZL-000079: 26,000 (FULLY_CREDIT) â†’ Outstanding: 26,000
  - PTZL-000078: 44,850 paid 44,850 â†’ Outstanding: 0
  - PTZL-000077: 20,000 paid 20,000 â†’ Outstanding: 0
  - PTZL-000076: 25,000 (FULLY_CREDIT) â†’ Outstanding: 25,000
  - PTZL-000075: 10,350 paid 10,350 â†’ Outstanding: 0
  - **Total Outstanding: 26,000 + 25,000 = 51,000** âœ…

### 3. Export PDF Showing Different Amounts
- **Problem:** "Export as PDF" and "Detailed PDF" show different amounts
- **Root Cause:** Not confirmed, but likely due to different data sources (simple vs detailed ledger data)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Outstanding Query Fix
**File:** `salesController.js` (lines 2687-2696)

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  s.customer_name,
  s.customer_phone as phone,
  -- Use the latest credit_amount as current outstanding balance
  (SELECT s2.credit_amount 
   FROM sales s2 
   WHERE s2.customer_name = s.customer_name 
     AND s2.customer_phone = s.customer_phone
     AND s2.scope_type IN ('BRANCH', 'WAREHOUSE')
   ORDER BY s2.created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 1) as total_outstanding,
  ...
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_name,
  s.customer_phone as phone,
  -- Calculate total outstanding as SUM(total - payment_amount)
  COALESCE(SUM(s.total - IF(s.payment_amount < 0, 0, s.payment_amount)), 0) as total_outstanding,
  COUNT(s.id) as pending_sales_count
FROM sales s
WHERE s.scope_type IN ('BRANCH', 'WAREHOUSE')
GROUP BY s.customer_name, s.customer_phone HAVING ABS(total_outstanding) > 0.01;
```

**Result:** The outstanding query now returns the correct sum of all unpaid amounts (51,000 for Dr. Ameen).

## Testing Checklist

After uploading and restarting:

- [ ] POS outstanding shows 51,000 for Dr. Ameen (not 26,000)
- [ ] Customer Ledger shows 51,000 for Dr. Ameen (outstanding balance)
- [ ] Export as PDF shows correct amounts
- [ ] Detailed PDF shows correct amounts
- [ ] Old balance shows 0 for first transaction (expected behavior)

## Files to Upload

1. **`salesController.js`** - Fixed outstanding query to use SUM instead of latest credit_amount
2. **All previous fixes** from `COMPLETE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Outstanding Balance Calculation:**
   - Changed from `latest credit_amount` to `SUM(total - payment_amount)`
   - Now correctly calculates the total outstanding across all transactions
   - Matches the Customer Ledger calculation

2. **Old Balance Logic:**
   - Remains unchanged (0 for first transaction is correct)
   - If there were previous transactions before the first visible one, they would show in the old balance

## Expected Results

### For Dr. Ameen:
- **POS Outstanding:** 51,000 âœ…
- **Customer Ledger Outstanding:** 51,000 âœ…
- **Export PDF Outstanding:** 51,000 âœ…
- **Detailed PDF Outstanding:** 51,000 âœ…
