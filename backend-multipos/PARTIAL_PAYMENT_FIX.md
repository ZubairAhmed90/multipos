# Partial Payment Search Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The POS system was not showing partial payments when searching by customer name because of a **status mismatch** in the backend API query.

### **Root Cause:**
- **Database Storage**: Partial payments are stored with `payment_status = 'PARTIAL'`
- **API Query**: The `searchOutstandingPayments` function was only searching for `payment_status = 'PENDING'`
- **Result**: Partial payments were excluded from outstanding payment search results

## 🛠️ **Files Fixed**

### 1. **Backend Controller** (`multipos/backend-multipos/controllers/salesController.js`)
```sql
-- BEFORE (Line 2286)
WHERE credit_amount > 0 
  AND payment_status = 'PENDING'

-- AFTER (Line 2286)
WHERE credit_amount > 0 
  AND (payment_status = 'PENDING' OR payment_status = 'PARTIAL')
```

### 2. **Backend API Updates** (`multipos/backend-multipos/backend-api-exact.js`)
```sql
-- BEFORE (Line 30)
WHERE credit_amount > 0 
  AND payment_status = 'PENDING'

-- AFTER (Line 30)
WHERE credit_amount > 0 
  AND (payment_status = 'PENDING' OR payment_status = 'PARTIAL')
```

### 3. **Implementation Guide** (`multipos/backend-multipos/03-backend-api-updates.js`)
```sql
-- BEFORE (Line 165)
WHERE s.payment_status = 'Pending' 
  AND s.credit_amount > 0

-- AFTER (Line 165)
WHERE (s.payment_status = 'Pending' OR s.payment_status = 'PARTIAL')
  AND s.credit_amount > 0
```

## 🎯 **What This Fixes**

### **Before Fix:**
- Customer "Ahmed" with partial payment (status: PARTIAL) → **Not shown** in outstanding search
- Only fully credited sales (status: PENDING) were visible
- POS showed "No outstanding payments found" even when partial payments existed

### **After Fix:**
- Customer "Ahmed" with partial payment (status: PARTIAL) → **Now shown** in outstanding search
- Both PENDING and PARTIAL status payments are included
- POS correctly displays outstanding amounts for partial payments

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **Customer Search**: When searching for "Ahmed" in POS
2. **API Response**: Returns outstanding amount including partial payments
3. **UI Display**: Shows "Outstanding Payments" section with correct amount
4. **Payment Processing**: Allows clearing partial payments using available payment methods

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd multipos/backend-multipos
node test-outstanding-fix.js
```

This will show:
- ✅ New query finds partial payments
- ❌ Old query misses partial payments  
- 📋 All customer sales records for verification

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Restart Backend**: Restart the backend server to apply changes
2. **Test POS**: Search for "Ahmed" in POS terminal
3. **Verify**: Outstanding payments should now appear correctly
4. **Cleanup**: Remove test file after verification

The partial payment search issue is now **RESOLVED**! 🎉
