# Complete Ledger Management System - How Sales Are Recorded

## üè¶ **Double-Entry Bookkeeping System**

When anyone makes a sale, the system automatically records **multiple ledger entries** following proper accounting principles. Here's exactly what happens:

## üìä **Sale Transaction Recording Process**

### **Step 1: Sale Creation**
When a sale is made (POS terminal, warehouse billing, etc.), the system:

1. **Creates the sale record** in the `sales` table
2. **Updates inventory** (reduces stock)
3. **Records ledger entries** with proper debit/credit accounts

### **Step 2: Automatic Ledger Entries**

For **every sale**, the system creates these ledger entries:

#### **üí∞ Cash Sale (Full Payment)**
```
DEBIT  Cash Account           $100.00  (Money received)
CREDIT Sales Revenue          $100.00  (Revenue earned)
DEBIT  Cost of Goods Sold     $60.00   (Cost of items sold)
CREDIT Inventory              $60.00   (Inventory reduced)
```

#### **üí≥ Partial Payment Sale**
```
DEBIT  Cash Account           $60.00   (Partial payment received)
DEBIT  Accounts Receivable    $40.00   (Credit to customer)
CREDIT Sales Revenue          $100.00  (Total revenue)
DEBIT  Cost of Goods Sold     $60.00   (Cost of items sold)
CREDIT Inventory              $60.00   (Inventory reduced)
```

#### **üìù Full Credit Sale**
```
DEBIT  Accounts Receivable    $100.00  (Full credit to customer)
CREDIT Sales Revenue          $100.00  (Revenue earned)
DEBIT  Cost of Goods Sold     $60.00   (Cost of items sold)
CREDIT Inventory              $60.00   (Inventory reduced)
```
